Things to test:

disclaimer: wla ko nag Swing UI so expect console ra ni hahaha

Legend:
  ER - expected result
  AR - actual result

@ test
  ideal - ER must be equal to AR

@ Db
1) Execute scripts in order
   - project... .sql
   -Create accounts .. .sql
     ER - Executes successfull without errors

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
 - ensure that the .java files are all in the same folder
 - the .jar is needed to connect the java to the java app
   make sure it is in the same dir as the .java source files
 - its the LoginTracker.java that contains the main method. Kana lng
   i-parse. e.g. javac LoginTracker.java

 - to run the app additional parameters are needed: 
 
  full command: java -cp .;C:/Path_of_jar_file LoginTracker

Notes: Wla pa ko nag-error handling sa wrong input sa choices
 so medyo fragile ang code nko. Try lng sa ug input sa correct choices to test the following above. Thanks!


Pre-requisites:
  - Successful MySQL db installation
  - jar file at the same folder as the LoginTracker.java
  - environmental variables for java is set (eg. no errors
      when executing javac command)
