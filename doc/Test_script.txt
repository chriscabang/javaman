Things to test:

disclaimer: wla ko nag Swing UI so expect console ra ni hahaha

Legend:
  ER - expected result
  AR - actual result

@ test
  ideal - ER must be equal to AR

@ Db
1) Execute scripts in order
   - project... .sql
   -Create accounts .. .sql
     ER - Executes successfull without errors

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
 - ensure that the .java files are all in the same folder
 - the .jar is needed to connect the java to the java app
   make sure it is in the same dir as the .java source files
 - its the LoginTracker.java that contains the main method. Kana lng
   i-parse. e.g. javac LoginTracker.java

 - to run the app additional parameters are needed: 
 
  full command: java -cp .;C:/Path_of_jar_file LoginTracker


--------------------------------------
@ App

1) Program
    Action:
      > Parse LoginTracker.java

       >> Delete a valid record (as employee)
        ER - record successfully deleted
           - should reflect in db as well
           - there should be no errors prompted

      >> Delete a null/invalid record (as employee)

                      the like.

      Test the integrated UI and functionalities at your end


  -Consider:
       - Log in as a User and as Admin and test all features.
       -Note: "Sign Out" should exit the frame
              "Create User" Create button success or fail would still exit 	       frame (except if naay exceptions)
              Delete User Cancel button would exit the frame
             
        Note: At admin, "Delete Log" won't work yet on initial load of 
              Record logs, press the "Show All Employees log" and press again
              to refresh the list of record logs. Bug ni but I'll fix
              it don't worry hehe.

       Note: the prompts if success ang action e.g. "Sign Out" for now 
            is prompted at the console window. No UI for that yet. Pero,
            himo-on nya nko kung ma-dala pa... For now, observe lng sa
            console window.

        Also note: Code is fragile, no proper error handling is done yet so
            palihug lng for the mean time input correctly like using 
            numbers for the ID field and Filling up all fields sa "Create 	    User" to avoid  punishments from java hehe. 
  
   In my end, mo-refine nya ko sa code, making it robust and "cleaner".       

 	              
Thanks!
